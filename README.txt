SideFX Houdini - Project manager Python Panel

This Python panel allows to set the project and displays all the .hip files as well as their last modification date.
In order for it to work you will need to paste this repository in your houdini documents folder (C:\Users\"Your User"\Documents\houdiniX.X\scripts\ ) under the scripts folder
The projectui.ui file is an interface created with Qt Designer
Lastly you will need to create a new python panel and type there the first commented lines inside the project.py in order to load the script inside houdini
