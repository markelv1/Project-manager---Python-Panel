- This Python panel allows to set the project and displays all the .hip files as well as their last modification date.

- In order for it to work you will need to paste this repository in your houdini documents folder (C:\Users\"Your User"\Documents\houdiniX.X\scripts\ ) under the scripts folder.

- The projectui.ui file is an interface created with Qt Designer.

- Lastly you will need to create a new python panel and type there the first commented lines inside the project.py in order to load the script inside houdini.
